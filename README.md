# Motocross App - Olyvia Hix

WeRide is for the avid motocross enthusiast. I wanted to create this app as I, myself, have been riding motocross my whole life.
This app allows you to pick a track local to Southern California and enter your own taken lap time at each track. It also allows you to see all of the lap times that have been added at each track, by any user! This is great to compare where you are in the competition as well as add to the fun and rankings of the tracks! There are some aspects that will be added yet! See below!

This is my first full-stack project that I have created. The technologies that were used in this project are JavaScript, HTML, and CSS, as well as incorporating a database that logs the lap times and users names when entering their names and times. I used sequelize, PostgreSQL and DBVisualizer.

Some challenges that I faced during this project were learning to impliment a database and linking the tables that stored the information for the tracks and the users lap times. 

Some favorite aspects of this project that I incorporated is the styling and the easy to use concept. This is simple for anyone to do, and gives you quick, immediate results that you are looking for with only a couple clicks!

I plan on working on this project more so that you can add a bike size as well as enter more of a category of skill level to better compare your times. 

# How To Run WeRide
If working in VSCode, in our Index.html file, type "npm start". This will start the server and allow you to run the app. Right click anywhere in the app and "Open with live server". 

# How To Use WeRide
While in the project, you will come to one main screen. There is a top dropdown that allows you to choose a track listed. (All are local to Southern California for now). Select which track you have a lap time to enter for. Then enter your first name, last name, and lap time. Lap time must be in 00:00:00 format. Once you have added your information in these fields, click submit lap time. This will enter your information into a storage table for the specific track you selected. You can then go to the bottom dropdown and select the same track, or other tracks, and select the show lap times button. This will show ALL of the lap times that have been entered for the specific track that you have selected. I plan on building more on this app as stated previously.
